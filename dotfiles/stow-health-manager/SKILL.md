# Stow Health Manager Skill

## Purpose

Prevents and fixes the most catastrophic dotfiles failure mode: broken symlinks. Automatically detects broken links, identifies conflicts, finds configuration drift, and safely repairs issues with backup and rollback capabilities. Essential for maintaining healthy stow-managed dotfiles.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:
- Asks to "check stow health" or "verify dotfiles"
- Says "fix symlinks" or "repair stow"
- Reports configuration issues or missing files
- Wants to validate dotfiles setup
- Before major changes (as safety check)
- After manual file operations in home directory
- Suspects config drift or stow conflicts

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Detection

**Locate Stow-Managed Directories**:

```bash
# Find dotfiles repository
# Common locations:
DOTFILES_DIRS=(
    ~/dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles
    ~/dev/dotfiles
    ~/.config/dotfiles
)

# Or ask user
echo "Where is your dotfiles repository?"

# Detect stow structure (directories with .config/ subdirs)
find "$DOTFILES_DIR" -maxdepth 2 -type d -name ".config" -o -name "bin"
```

**Identify Stow Targets**:

```bash
# Typically stow creates links in:
STOW_TARGETS=(
    ~/ # Home directory
    ~/.config/ # Config directory
    ~/.local/bin/ # Local binaries
)

# Detect by finding existing stow symlinks
find ~ -maxdepth 2 -type l -exec readlink {} \; | grep -o "dotfiles/[^/]*" | sort -u
```

### Phase 2: Health Analysis

**Scan for Broken Symlinks**:

```bash
# Find all symlinks pointing to dotfiles
find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" 2>/dev/null | while read link; do
    target=$(readlink "$link")

    # Check if target exists
    if [ ! -e "$target" ]; then
        echo "BROKEN: $link -> $target"
    fi
done

# Detailed broken link analysis
broken_links=()
for link in $(find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" 2>/dev/null); do
    if [ ! -e "$link" ]; then
        target=$(readlink "$link")
        broken_links+=("$link|$target")
    fi
done
```

**Identify Stow Conflicts**:

```bash
# Conflicts = files/dirs that would be created by stow but already exist

# Get list of what stow WOULD create
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR"
stow -n -v component-name 2>&1 | grep "existing target is neither"

# For each component, check for conflicts
for component in */; do
    component_name=${component%/}

    # Simulate stow to find conflicts
    conflicts=$(stow -n "$component_name" 2>&1 | grep -E "existing|conflict")

    if [ -n "$conflicts" ]; then
        echo "CONFLICT in $component_name: $conflicts"
    fi
done
```

**Detect Configuration Drift**:

```bash
# Drift = symlinked files that were modified/replaced with regular files

# This shouldn't happen, but users sometimes:
# 1. Delete symlink
# 2. Create regular file in same location
# 3. Edit it, forgetting it's no longer tracked

# Detect files that SHOULD be symlinks but aren't
expected_links=(
    ~/.zshrc
    ~/.tmux.conf
    ~/.config/yabai/yabairc
    ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc
    # ... detect from dotfiles repo
)

for file in "${expected_links[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [ ! -L "$file" ]; then
        echo "DRIFT: $file is regular file, should be symlink"

        # Check if content differs from repo
        repo_file="$DOTFILES_DIR/component/.../$(basename $file)"
        if ! diff -q "$file" "$repo_file" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "  AND HAS UNCOMMITTED CHANGES!"
        fi
    fi
done
```

**Find Orphaned Symlinks**:

```bash
# Orphaned = symlinks to dotfiles repo for components no longer stowed

# Get currently stowed components (have active symlinks)
active_components=$(find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" | \
    grep -o "dotfiles/[^/]*" | sort -u)

# Get all components in repo
repo_components=$(ls -d "$DOTFILES_DIR"/*/ | xargs -n1 basename)

# Find components in repo but not linked
for comp in $repo_components; do
    if ! echo "$active_components" | grep -q "$comp"; then
        echo "UNSTOWED: $comp (exists in repo but not linked)"
    fi
done
```

### Phase 3: Health Report Generation

**Categorize Issues**:

```
CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required):
‚ùå Broken symlinks (12 found)
  - ~/.config/nvim/init.lua -> ~/dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/init.lua (target missing)
  - ~/.zshrc -> ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc (target missing)

HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix Soon):
‚ö†Ô∏è Stow conflicts (3 found)
  - ~/.gitconfig exists, blocking git component
  - ~/.config/ghostty/ directory exists, blocking ghostty component

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Review and Decide):
üìù Configuration drift (2 found)
  - ~/.tmux.conf is regular file (should be symlink)
    Content differs from repo - has uncommitted changes!

INFORMATIONAL:
‚ÑπÔ∏è Unstowed components (1 found)
  - karabiner (in repo but not stowed)

SUMMARY:
  Total symlinks: 47
  Healthy links: 35 ‚úÖ
  Broken links: 12 ‚ùå
  Conflicts: 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è
  Drift detected: 2 üìù
  Overall health: 74% (needs attention)
```

### Phase 4: Interactive Repair

**Offer Repair Options**:

```
Found 12 broken symlinks. How to proceed?

1. [AUTO REPAIR] Automatically fix (recommended)
   - Backs up current state
   - Removes broken links
   - Re-stows affected components
   - Verifies all links healthy

2. [MANUAL REVIEW] Show each issue, let me decide
   - Review each broken link
   - Choose action per issue
   - More control, takes longer

3. [REPORT ONLY] Just show me the issues
   - No changes made
   - I'll fix manually

Choice:
```

**Auto-Repair Workflow**:

```bash
# 1. Create backup
backup_dir="$HOME/.dotfiles-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"

echo "Creating backup at $backup_dir..."

# Backup broken links and their targets
for link in "${broken_links[@]}"; do
    link_path=${link%|*}
    target=${link#*|}

    # Save link info
    echo "$link_path -> $target" >> "$backup_dir/broken-links.txt"

    # If file exists, backup it
    if [ -e "$link_path" ]; then
        cp -a "$link_path" "$backup_dir/"
    fi
done

# 2. Remove broken links
echo "Removing broken symlinks..."
for link in "${broken_links[@]}"; do
    link_path=${link%|*}
    rm "$link_path"
    echo "  Removed: $link_path"
done

# 3. Identify affected components
affected_components=()
for link in "${broken_links[@]}"; do
    target=${link#*|}
    # Extract component name from path
    component=$(echo "$target" | grep -o "dotfiles/[^/]*" | cut -d/ -f2)
    affected_components+=("$component")
done

# Remove duplicates
affected_components=($(echo "${affected_components[@]}" | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -u))

# 4. Re-stow affected components
echo "Re-stowing components: ${affected_components[@]}"
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR"

for component in "${affected_components[@]}"; do
    echo "  Restowing $component..."
    stow -R "$component"

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "    ‚úÖ Success"
    else
        echo "    ‚ùå Failed"
        echo "    Rolling back..."
        # Restore from backup
        stow -D "$component"
        # Show error
        stow -R "$component" 2>&1
    fi
done

# 5. Verify repair
echo "Verifying repair..."
remaining_broken=$(find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" ! -e 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

if [ "$remaining_broken" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ All symlinks repaired successfully!"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Still have $remaining_broken broken links"
    echo "   Manual intervention may be needed"
fi
```

**Conflict Resolution**:

```bash
# For each conflict, offer options:

Conflict: ~/.gitconfig already exists (regular file)
  Blocking: git component from being stowed

Options:
1. [ADOPT] Move existing file into dotfiles repo
   - Moves ~/.gitconfig to ~/dotfiles/git/.gitconfig
   - Stows git component (creates symlink)
   - Preserves your config, now tracked

2. [BACKUP & REPLACE] Backup existing, use dotfiles version
   - Backs up ~/.gitconfig to $backup_dir
   - Stows git component (replaces with symlink)
   - Old config saved for reference

3. [SKIP] Leave as-is
   - Keep regular file
   - Don't stow git component
   - No changes

Choice:
```

**Drift Resolution**:

```bash
# Configuration drift handling

Drift detected: ~/.tmux.conf
  Current: Regular file with local modifications
  Expected: Symlink to ~/dotfiles/tmux/.tmux.conf
  Diff: 47 lines changed

Options:
1. [COMMIT CHANGES] Save changes to dotfiles repo
   - Copy current file to dotfiles repo
   - Commit changes
   - Convert to symlink
   - Preserves all modifications

2. [DISCARD CHANGES] Revert to dotfiles version
   - Backs up current file
   - Removes regular file
   - Re-stows tmux component
   - Uses repo version

3. [SHOW DIFF] See what changed
   - Display detailed diff
   - Then choose option

4. [SKIP] Leave as-is
   - Keep regular file
   - Manual resolution needed

Choice:
```

### Phase 5: Verification

**Post-Repair Checks**:

```bash
# 1. Count symlinks
total_links=$(find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
broken_links=$(find ~ -type l -lname "*dotfiles*" ! -e 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
healthy_links=$((total_links - broken_links))

# 2. Verify critical configs
critical_configs=(
    ~/.zshrc
    ~/.tmux.conf
    ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
    ~/.config/yabai/yabairc
    ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc
)

all_healthy=true
for config in "${critical_configs[@]}"; do
    if [ -L "$config" ] && [ -e "$config" ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ $config"
    else
        echo "‚ùå $config (PROBLEM)"
        all_healthy=false
    fi
done

# 3. Test stow status
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR"
for component in */; do
    component_name=${component%/}

    # Dry-run stow to check for issues
    if stow -n "$component_name" 2>&1 | grep -q "conflict"; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è $component_name still has conflicts"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ $component_name"
    fi
done

# 4. Final health score
health_percentage=$((healthy_links * 100 / total_links))
echo "Overall Health: $health_percentage%"

if [ "$health_percentage" -eq 100 ]; then
    echo "üéâ Perfect health!"
elif [ "$health_percentage" -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Good health"
elif [ "$health_percentage" -ge 75 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Needs attention"
else
    echo "‚ùå Poor health - manual review recommended"
fi
```

```

## Guidelines

### DO:
‚úÖ Always create backup before any destructive operation
‚úÖ Provide clear, actionable options for conflict resolution
‚úÖ Verify repairs with post-check scans
‚úÖ Show detailed reports of what changed
‚úÖ Offer rollback instructions
‚úÖ Detect all types of issues (broken, conflicts, drift)
‚úÖ Support both auto and manual repair modes
‚úÖ Preserve user data (adopt, don't delete)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Delete files without backing up
‚ùå Auto-fix without showing what will change
‚ùå Overwrite modified configs without warning
‚ùå Skip verification after repair
‚ùå Leave user in broken state
‚ùå Assume dotfiles repo location
‚ùå Force changes without user confirmation for conflicts

## Advanced Features

### Preventive Mode

Run before major operations:
```
Before: "I'm about to upgrade all my dotfiles"
Action: Run health check first
Result: Ensures clean state before changes
```

### Scheduled Health Checks

Add to cron/launchd:
```bash
# Daily health check
0 9 * * * claude-code --skill stow-health-manager "check stow health" > ~/stow-health.log
```

### Integration with Pre-Commit

Works with Pre-Commit Guardian:
```
1. Pre-Commit Guardian validates configs
2. If pass, commits
3. Stow Health Manager verifies links still healthy
4. Report any drift
```

## Dependencies

- **stow**: GNU Stow for symlink management
- **find**: Finding symlinks
- **readlink**: Reading link targets
- **diff**: Comparing files for drift detection
- **git**: For dotfiles repo operations (optional)

## Configuration

No configuration needed - auto-detects dotfiles repo location.

**Optional Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Override dotfiles location
export DOTFILES_DIR=~/my-dotfiles

# Skip backup (not recommended)
export STOW_HEALTH_NO_BACKUP=1

# Auto-accept all repairs (dangerous!)
export STOW_HEALTH_AUTO_YES=1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Skill can't find dotfiles repo

**Solution**:
```bash
# Specify location
export DOTFILES_DIR=~/path/to/dotfiles

# Or when prompted:
"Where is your dotfiles repository?"
> ~/my-custom-dotfiles
```

### Issue: Too many broken links to fix

**Solution**:
```
1. Start with critical configs only
2. Use manual review mode
3. Fix incrementally
4. Consider fresh stow:
   cd ~/dotfiles && stow -D */ && stow */
```

### Issue: Conflicts won't resolve

**Solution**:
```
1. Backup the conflicting file
2. Remove it manually
3. Run stow again
4. Compare backup with new symlink target
5. Merge any needed changes
```

## Success Metrics

A successful stow health check includes:
- ‚úÖ All symlinks scanned
- ‚úÖ Broken links identified
- ‚úÖ Conflicts detected
- ‚úÖ Drift found
- ‚úÖ Clear repair options offered
- ‚úÖ Backup created before changes
- ‚úÖ All repairs verified
- ‚úÖ Final health score 90%+
