**Text**: (as top comment)

Author here. I built this after realizing I was spending 10-20 hours a week on repetitive dotfiles tasks: restarting services, checking symlinks, validating configs before commits, updating dependencies, etc.

The repository includes 10 production-ready skills that automate these workflows with intelligent safety checks. For example:

- Service Orchestrator validates configs before restarting yabai/skhd/sketchybar in dependency order
- Stow Health Manager scans for broken symlinks and auto-repairs with backup
- Pre-Commit Guardian blocks git commits with syntax errors
- Dependency Update Manager categorizes updates by risk and tests everything

All skills follow a safety-first design: validation ‚Üí backup ‚Üí execution ‚Üí verification ‚Üí rollback if needed.

Built with Claude Code (claude.com/claude-code), but the workflows and patterns should be useful regardless of tool choice.

Open to feedback and contributions!
